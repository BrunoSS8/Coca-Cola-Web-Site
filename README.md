# Coca Cola Web Site
 I made this web page for Coca Cola, using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript, using the client's colors and an interactive area for the product's consumer, where it is possible to select the desired product, passing the mouse cursor and holding on the product and dragging to the side, a kind of carousel made with swiper, thus demonstrating the selected product in a swiper way, a way to demonstrate the use of the tool in an interactive and beautiful way, which allows the brand that owns the site in this case Coca Cola make use of this tool to demonstrate your product line.
